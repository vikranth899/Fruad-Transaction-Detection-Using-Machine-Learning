<h1>Fraud Transaction Detection Using Machine Learning</h1>
<p>This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using various machine learning models. The primary goal is to build a robust and accurate system capable of identifying potential fraud in financial transactions.</p>
<h2>Models Used:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</li>
  <li>Logistic Regression</li>
  <li>Random Forest</li>
  <li>Bernoulli Naive Bayes (NB)</li>
  <li>XGBoost</li>
  <li>CatBoost</li>
</ul>

<h2>Base Estimators:</h2>
<p>To enhance model performance, base estimators were applied to the following models:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Random Forest</li>
  <li>Bernoulli NB</li>
  <li>XGBoost</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Outcomes:</h2>
<p>The implementation of these models and techniques resulted in a system capable of identifying fraudulent transactions with high accuracy. The combination of ensemble methods and base estimators contributed to minimizing false positives and false negatives, leading to a reliable fraud detection system.</p>
